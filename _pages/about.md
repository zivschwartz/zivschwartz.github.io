About Me
======
Hi! I'm Ziv, a recent graduate from the Center for Data Science at New York University with a *Master's Degree in Data Science*. As a Data Scientist, I love harnassing the power of data to tell stories and answer questions. My main areas of interest include **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Augmented Analytics**, and **Cognitive Computing**. Over the course of my academic and professional career, I have been particularly fascinated by the intersection of perspective analytics ("What should we do?") and the ever-expanding role of automation and artificial intellegence (AI) on the current Data Science landscape. My portfolio showcases a wide variety of Big Data and Machine Learning projects, including two Capstone projects, UCLA Statistics (BS) 2018 and NYU Data Science (MS) 2020.
