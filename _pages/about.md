About Me
======
Hi! Iâ€™m Ziv, an Applied Scientist at Amazon. NYU Center for Data Science (MS) and UCLA (BS & BA) graduate.

As a Data Scientist, I love harnessing the power of data to tell stories and answer questions. My main areas of interest include **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Augmented Analytics**, and **Cognitive Computing**. Over the course of my academic and professional career, I have been particularly fascinated by the intersection of perspective analytics ("What should we do?") and the ever-expanding role of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) on the current Data Science landscape. My portfolio showcases a wide variety of Big Data and Machine Learning projects, including two Capstone projects, UCLA Statistics (BS) 2018 and NYU Data Science (MS) 2020.
